@article{sharma_general_1979,
	Abstract = {This paper contains a derivation of general expressions for reducing Slater-Koster integrals Eij(l,m,n) to the two-center approximation for orbitals i (and j) having arbitrary angular momentum quantum numbers; l,m,n describe the location of one center relative to the other. This has allowed the author to check the entries in Table I of the Slater-Koster paper and provides a means for extending these entries to include states of higher angular momenta. The derived general expressions are especially useful for machine calculations when a large number of particular expressions are required to be evaluated. As a collateral result the missing factors in the energy matrix elements along the Î” line for the face-centered cubic structure given by Slater and Koster and reviewed by Reitz have been noted.},

@article{dixon_high_1967,
	Abstract = {This paper describes a practical procedure for computing the ordinary irreducible characters of finite groups (of orders up to 1000 or so). The novelty of the method consists of transposing the problem from the field of complex numbers into the field of integers modulop for a suitable primep. It is much easier to compute the modular characters in the latter field, and from these characters we can calculate the ordinary irreducible characters in algebraic form.},

@article{schneider_dixons_1990,

This paper describes a method for overcoming these difficulties. In addition, an algorithm is presented that has a high probability of determining the two characters that span a two-dimensional character space without the need for computing an additional class matrix.},

@article{unger_computing_2006,
	Abstract = {Brauer's theorem on induced characters is an invitation to an algorithm for computing the character table of a finite group. We describe an implementation of such an algorithm and report on its performance. The main ingredients of the algorithm are Brauer's theorem, and lattice reduction by {LLL}. We report on the performance of the algorithm in computing character tables of various groups, including local subgroups of 3 F i 24 and maximal subgroups of the Monster. We find that for many interesting groups it performs far better than using the current standard method (Burnside--Dixon--Schneider).},

@book{el-batanouny_symmetry_2008,
	Abstract = {Unlike existing texts, this book blends for the first time three topics in physics - symmetry, condensed matter physics and computational methods - into one pedagogical textbook. It includes new concepts in mathematical crystallography; experimental methods capitalizing on symmetry aspects; non-conventional applications such as Fourier crystallography, color groups, quasicrystals and incommensurate systems; as well as concepts and techniques behind the Landau theory of phase transitions. Adopting a computational approach to the application of group theoretical techniques to solving symmetry related problems, it dramatically alleviates the need for intensive calculations usually found in the presentation of symmetry. Writing computer programs helps the student achieve a firm understanding of the underlying concepts, and sample programs, based on Mathematica, are presented throughout the book. Containing over 150 exercises, this textbook is ideal for graduate students in condensed matter physics, materials science, and chemistry. Solutions and computer programs are available online at www.cambridge.org/9780521828451.},

@book{shankar_fundamentals_2014,
	Abstract = {Professor R. Shankar, a well-known physicist and contagiously enthusiastic educator, was among the first to offer a course through the innovative Open Yale Course program. His popular online video lectures on introductory physics have been viewed over a million times. In this concise and self-contained book based on his online Yale course, Shankar explains the fundamental concepts of physics from Galileo's and Newton's discoveries to the twentieth-century's revolutionary ideas on relativity and quantum mechanics.   The book begins at the simplest level, develops the basics, and reinforces fundamentals, ensuring a solid foundation in the principles and methods of physics. It provides an ideal introduction for college-level students of physics, chemistry, and engineering, for motivated {AP} Physics students, and for general readers interested in advances in the sciences. Instructor resources--including problem sets and sample examinations--and more information about Professor Shankar's course are available at http://oyc.yale.edu/physics/phys-200.},
