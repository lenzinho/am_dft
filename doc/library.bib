@book{el-batanouny_symmetry_2008,
	Abstract = {Unlike existing texts, this book blends for the first time three topics in physics - symmetry, condensed matter physics and computational methods - into one pedagogical textbook. It includes new concepts in mathematical crystallography; experimental methods capitalizing on symmetry aspects; non-conventional applications such as Fourier crystallography, color groups, quasicrystals and incommensurate systems; as well as concepts and techniques behind the Landau theory of phase transitions. Adopting a computational approach to the application of group theoretical techniques to solving symmetry related problems, it dramatically alleviates the need for intensive calculations usually found in the presentation of symmetry. Writing computer programs helps the student achieve a firm understanding of the underlying concepts, and sample programs, based on Mathematica, are presented throughout the book. Containing over 150 exercises, this textbook is ideal for graduate students in condensed matter physics, materials science, and chemistry. Solutions and computer programs are available online at www.cambridge.org/9780521828451.},

@book{shankar_fundamentals_2014,
	Abstract = {Professor R. Shankar, a well-known physicist and contagiously enthusiastic educator, was among the first to offer a course through the innovative Open Yale Course program. His popular online video lectures on introductory physics have been viewed over a million times. In this concise and self-contained book based on his online Yale course, Shankar explains the fundamental concepts of physics from Galileo's and Newton's discoveries to the twentieth-century's revolutionary ideas on relativity and quantum mechanics.   The book begins at the simplest level, develops the basics, and reinforces fundamentals, ensuring a solid foundation in the principles and methods of physics. It provides an ideal introduction for college-level students of physics, chemistry, and engineering, for motivated {AP} Physics students, and for general readers interested in advances in the sciences. Instructor resources--including problem sets and sample examinations--and more information about Professor Shankar's course are available at http://oyc.yale.edu/physics/phys-200.},
